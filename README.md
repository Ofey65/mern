# Stack MERN to build nice web apps

This is my repo with some quick setup scripts to build an Webapp using the **stack MERN**
if you are interested on this project you can send me an email or clone my repo to start 
adding your own code.

## Quick setup and install
 
* In order to run this code you need first to install **npm** and **git** (indeed you must to install **mongodb** too
 to manage a local database) buddy so google them 
and install them.

* Then you need to install the npm packages that are required for the app, you can do that with npm,
open your console and run the command:

  ```
  npm init -y 
  ```
  Then install the required packages with the command:
  ```
  npm i 
  ```
  
* That's all my friend, so now you can run this app in *development* mode with the command:
  ```
  npm run development
  ```
  
Have a fun and if you have any question you can share it with me in the comments
